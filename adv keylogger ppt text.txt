Python and Telegram API:

Utilizes Python programming language for its versatility and cross-platform compatibility
Employs Telegram API to seamlessly integrate with the Telegram messaging platform for remote monitoring
Data Collection and Transmission:

Captures keystrokes in real-time
Transmits captured data to a designated Telegram channel for remote access

Slide 4: Key Features

Real-time Keystroke Capture:

Captures keystrokes as they occur, providing immediate insights into user activity
Records key presses, including special keys and non-character inputs
Stealth Operation:

Designed to operate undetected, maintaining the privacy of monitoring activities
Employs techniques to avoid detection by antivirus software and maintain persistence
Telegram Integration:

Sends captured keystrokes to a designated Telegram channel for remote monitoring
Leverages Telegram API for seamless communication and data transfer
Customizable Logging:

Allows for filtering and categorizing captured keystrokes based on specific criteria
Enables selective logging for efficient data analysis and storage

Slide 5: Technical Implementation

Core Components:

pynput: A Python library for capturing and processing keyboard events
tkinter: A Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests to Telegram API
Python Libraries and Modules:

Utilizes pynput.keyboard module for keystroke capture
Employs tkinter.Tk() class to create the main GUI window
Leverages requests.post() method to send data to Telegram API
Telegram API Integration:

Utilizes bot_token and chat_id variables to identify the Telegram bot and chat

Slide 6: Real-time Keystroke Capture

Mechanism:

Employs a keyboard event listener to capture key presses
Continuously monitors user activity and records keystrokes in real-time
Handling Special Keys and Non-Character Inputs:

Utilizes pynput.special module to handle special keys like Enter, Backspace, and Shift
Captures non-character inputs like function keys and modifier keys

Slide 7: Stealth Operation

Techniques:

Utilizes low-level keyboard hooks to avoid detection by antivirus software
Employs techniques to minimize resource usage and maintain system stability
Implements persistence mechanisms to ensure continuous monitoring
Importance of Persistence:

Guarantees continuous monitoring even after system reboots or logouts
Enables long-term tracking of user activity and pattern recognition
